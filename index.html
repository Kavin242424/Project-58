        <p>My hobby is doing Nothing. Of course I am not actually doing nothing. I breathe stand around and think too much about stuff.I mostly look at stuff from different perspective. I think my personal things too, I also make decisions and decide what's next in the day. So, its basically my thinking time but Doing Nothing has more pizzaz.</p>
